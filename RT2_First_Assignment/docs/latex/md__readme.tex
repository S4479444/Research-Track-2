The task of this assignment was to implement three nodes in the robot simulation presented in the course. The three nodes are described as following\+:

1) Action Client node, allowing the user to set a target position (x, y) or to cancel it; 2) Service node, that prints the number of objectives, both reached and canceled after the user\textquotesingle{}s request; 3) A node that subscribes to the robot\textquotesingle{}s odometry, and prints the distance from target, as well as the average velocity.

It is also required to create a launch file to start the simulation (rt1\+\_\+second\+\_\+assignment.\+launch).

Run the following command from the shell\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/CarmineD8/assignment\_2\_2022.git}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ git clone https://github.com/S4479444/rt1\_second\_assignment.git}
\end{DoxyCode}


Just for be prudent , it is recommended to run the following commands if a build in the catkin workspace was done beforehand\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ sudo rm -\/rf devel/}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ sudo rm -\/rf build/}
\end{DoxyCode}


Then, run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ catkin\_make }
\end{DoxyCode}


If not installed, install Konsole\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ sudo apt-\/get install konsole}
\end{DoxyCode}


Finally, the final steps are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ sudo bash run\_project.sh \#inside the directory of the project.}
\end{DoxyCode}

The program will open five windows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Gazebo}\+: A 3D visualization setup will be used to depict the arena and the robot.
\item {\itshape Rviz}\+: a R\+OS visualization tool is employed for robot debugging and the development of new features.
\item {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{sub__pos_8py}{sub\+\_\+pos.\+py}}}\+: the display window where mesuarment about the robot will be printed .
\item {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{action__client_8py}{action\+\_\+client.\+py}}}\+: twindow through which a user can enter a goal or cancel it.
\end{DoxyItemize}
